# The Sour

Here is a trick for remembering hundreds of cocktails: the sour. A sour is a cocktail made from the following recipe:

* 2 oz spirit
* ¾ oz citrus juice
* ¾ oz syrup

Add these to a shaker with ice, shake, and strain into a glass. You can use any spirit, from whiskey to rum to gin; any citrus (usually lemon or lime). You can even use a different syrup rather than plain simple syrup, such as honey syrup, agave, or maple syrup.

A [Daiquiri](/drinks/daiquiri/) is a sour made with rum and lime. A [Pinkest Gin](/drinks/pinkest-gin/) is gin and grapefruit—though the syrup is reduced to ½ oz due to the sweeter nature of grapefruit juice compared to lemon or lime.

You can create all sorts of fantastic drinks from this basic formula. Or you can up the game a bit with one of two enhancements:

## Add an egg white

An egg white does two things to the drink. First, it foams up a bit during shaking, adding a thicker, slightly creamy quality to the drink. Second, the proteins in the egg binds to the tannins present in some spirits, such as whiskey, making the flavor smoother. This is why an egg white is added to a [Whiskey Sour](/drinks/maple-bourbon-sour/).

## Add a liqueur

Adding a sweet liqueur to a sour is a great way to bring it to the next level (start with ¾ oz and adjust as needed from there). When you do this, you will typically need to change your measurements a bit to keep the flavors balanced—typically this means reducing both the syrup and base spirit to keep the sweetness and alcohol flavor in check.

A [Margarita](/drinks/margarita/) is a tequila-lime sour with orange liqueur added. My [Tabs vs. Spaces](/drinks/tabs-vs-spaces/) is the same thing but with Green Chartreuse. A [Sidecar](/drinks/sidecar/) is a brandy-lemon sour with orange liqueur. And a [White Lady](/drinks/white-lady/) is a gin-lemon sour with both orange liqueur and an egg white added.

If you want to invent your own cocktail, a sour is a fantastically easy place to start. Many of the obvious combinations are already well known, but use an unusual syrup flavor or the right liqueur and there’s no telling what you may discover. Maybe you could try gin and lemon with a rosemary syrup, or tequila and grapefruit with syrup made from prickly pear fruit—in fact, those both sound interesting and I may very well give them a shot.
