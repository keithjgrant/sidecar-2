# Butter Syrup

This is a fun syrup that contains emulsified butter. I got this recipe from Dave Arnold’s [Liquid Intelligence](https://www.amazon.com/Liquid-Intelligence-Science-Perfect-Cocktail/dp/0393089037). It uses an emulsifier called “TIC Pretested Ticaloid 210S”, which is basically a combination of powdered gum arabic and xanthan gum in a 9:1 ratio. You can buy the Ticaloid or make your own (just be sure to get food-grade gum arabic if you do).

* 200 grams water
* 3 grams Ticaloid powder (about 1½ tsp)
* 130 grams melted butter
* 200 grams sugar
* 10 allspice berries, crushed

Heat the water and allspice berries, allowing them to infuse for five minutes or so. Remove from heat and strain out the allspice. Add Ticaloid powder and combine using a stick blender. Add melted butter and blend until smooth. Add sugar and blend one last time until smooth.

This can be stored at room temperature if you’re using it the same day, or in the fridge for several days.

If you’re going through the trouble of making this, [here are some drink ideas](/tags/butter-syrup) that use it.
