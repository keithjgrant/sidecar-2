# About Sidecar

I enjoy making cocktails, but I’m not a fan of most cocktail recipe books. I own one with 1,200 recipes. Half of them are terrible and others&mdash;well, let’s just say I don’t want four recipes for a [Manhattan](/drinks/manhattan). I want the one, *best* recipe for it.

Sidecar is different. These are only recipes that I have personally tested and enjoyed. Some of these are exactly as I found them. Others I have tinkered with for a while before landing on a final recipe. And a few I have [created myself](/tags/sidecar-original).

## About the Recipes

This is first and foremost *my* collection of cocktails. Some are very traditional. Some deviate wildly from tradition. You’re free to disagree with me, but I hope you give them a shot. I figure I might as well put this out here for anyone else who might enjoy it as well.

Be sure you understand the three techniques for making drinks: [building](/techniques/building/), [shaking](/techniques/shaking/), and [stirring](/techniques/stirring/). Where my recipes say “build”, “shake”, or “stir”, I mean something specific.

I’ll periodically add new entries for other important mixology skills, information about [ingredients and mixers](/ingredients), and, of course, new [drinks](/drinks/).

## A note about brand names

I’m annoyed when a recipe tells me what brand of liquor to use. I’m not going to stock four types of tequila in my home bar, and I wouldn’t expect you too, either. So in most of the recipes on Sidecar, I leave the brand up to you.

That said, every now and then, it really does matter. An [Elder Fashioned](/drinks/elder-fashioned) doesn’t work without Plymouth Gin and the [Bannon Tantrum](/drinks/bannon-tantrum) was designed specifically for Dry Fly Vodka’s unique flavor. So I strive to only specify name brands when I think it truly matters.

Some of my recipes might be balanced for a specific brand, but can easily work with another brand &mdash; though the measurements potentially require a little tweaking to get the flavor balance right. (This is particularly the case when it comes to liqueurs.) In these cases, I indicate the brand I use in parentheses and leave it to you to make any adjustments you might find necessary.
