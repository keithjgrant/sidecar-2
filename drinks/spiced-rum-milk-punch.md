**Cold**: Shake all ingredients in a cocktail shaker with ice. Strain into a rocks glass over fresh ice.

**Hot**: Put the rum, syrup, and vanilla in a metal shaker and heat it gently by placing the shaker in a bowl of hot water. Preheat a small mug with hot water. Meanwhile, heat the milk and froth it with a mixer or milk frother. Empty the mug and add the rum mixture; pour the hot milk into the rum and stir gently to combine.

Garnish with ground nutmeg and cinnamon.
