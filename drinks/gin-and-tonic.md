{{< summary >}}
A deceptively simple drink, these particular instructions are meant to minimize the amount of carbonation lost from the tonic water. Recipe by Dave Arnold.

Traditionally made with a London dry gin, but I think it’s fantastic with [genever-style gin](/ingredients/gin/#genever).

{{< instructions >}}
Pre-chill a rocks glass and gin in the freezer.

Add the gin to the rocks glass. Gently pour in the tonic water.

Squeeze the juice from the lime wedge into the glass. Gently add ice; this will stir the drink just enough to combine. Set the squeezed lime wedge atop the ice, so you can smell it as you take a sip.
