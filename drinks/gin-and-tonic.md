  A deceptively simple drink, these particular instructions are meant to minimize the amount of carbonation lost from the tonic water. Recipe by Dave Arnold.

Pre-chill a rocks glass and gin in the freezer.

Add the gin to the rocks glass. Gently pour in the tonic water.

Squeeze the juice from the lime wedge into the glass. Gently add ice; this will agitate the drink just enough to combine. Set the squeezed lime wedge atop the ice, so you can smell it as you take a sip.
