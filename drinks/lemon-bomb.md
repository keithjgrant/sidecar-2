intro: This is easier to make in batches of 2 or 4 drinks to make beating the egg whites easier, but here are the measurements for a single cocktail, which you can scale up as needed.
---
Add aged rum, butter syrup, lemon juice, and egg yolk to a cocktail shaker. [Dry shake](/techniques/shaking/#dry-shaking), then add ice and shake again. [Double-strain](/techniques/straining/#double-straining) into a coupe.

In a stand mixer, add egg white and begin beating. Add granulated sugar and white rum. Beat just until soft peaks begin to form. Spoon the foam over the top of the cocktail (some unincorporated liquid may remain at the bottom of the mixer bowl; discard it).

Garnish with lemon zest
