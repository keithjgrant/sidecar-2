intro: Some will argue an Old Fashioned must be made with a sugar cube. Those people haven't tried it with burnt sugar syrup. My measurement here may seem like a lot of syrup, but burnt sugar isn’t quite as sweet as normal simple syrup, and its bitterness adds extra complexity, so I find this amount provides a good balance.

Build in rocks glass. Add ice and stir briefly.

Express orange peel oils over the drink, then rub it around the rim of the glass and place it in the drink.
