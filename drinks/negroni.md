intro: The Negroni is quite sweet, but also bitter and complex. A bold, juniper-heavy gin like Tanqueray stands up to the strong flavors of Campari. An orange twist is traditional, but I like it with grapefruit a bit more.

Stir with plenty of ice. Strain into a coupe glass. It can also be served over ice in a rocks glass.

Express the oils from the grapefruit peel over the drink and add it to the glass.
