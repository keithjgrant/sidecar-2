intro: This is an in-your-face response to anyone who insists a martini must be dry. Aviation is a sweeter, less juniper-heavy gin that shines with a moderately sweet blanc vermouth. I even bump up the ratio of vermouth to 1:3 rather than my usual 1:4 [martini](/drinks/martini) ratio.

Add to cocktail shaker with plenty of ice. Stir well, then strain into a martini glass.

Garnish with a lemon twist.
