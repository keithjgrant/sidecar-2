I had this last year in a restaurant in the international terminal of the Atlanta airport. After a lot of experimenting, this is my recreation—though I suspect the original incorporated the ginger in some sort of bitters rather than a syrup, because my version is just a touch sweeter. The original was made with Templeton Rye and Hennessy Cognac.

Here’s a video tutorial for [making ginger syrup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Jx2t0DgoWc).
