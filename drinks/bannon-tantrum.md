  “The media should keep its mouth shut and just listen for awhile”&mdash;_Steve Bannon throwing a tantrum on Jan 26, 2017_

  This must be made with [Dry Fly brand vodka](http://www.dryflydistilling.com/dryfly-product/washington-wheat-vodka/); It has an amazing wheat flavor and I created this recipe specifically to let it shine.

Add everything to a shaker with ice. Shake. Strain into a rocks glass over ice.
