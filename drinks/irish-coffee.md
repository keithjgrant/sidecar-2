intro: |
  This approach uses [burnt sugar syrup](/ingredients/burnt-sugar-syrup) instead of granulated sugar, so I take pains to warm it and the whiskey before mixing with the coffee to avoid a lukewarm drink.

  Technically, any Irish whiskey will work, but you really ought to use Tullamore Dew.

Brew your coffee with the normal amount of grounds but half the normal amount of water so it is extra strong.

Pour hot water into the mug to pre-warm it, and into a small bowl. Add whiskey and burnt sugar syrup to a metal cocktail shaker. Place the shaker in the bowl to warm the whiskey and syrup. Do this while your coffee brews so it can sit for a couple minutes.

Pour out the hot water from the mug. Add the whiskey-syrup mixture and about 3½ oz coffee then stir briefly to combine. Then, holding a spoon just above the coffee, pour the frothed cream over the spoon so it floats atop the drink. Enjoy it while hot!
